1. Done
2. It can be seen as a clustering algorithm that works in 3 dimensions, with every dimension representing an RGB-channel. Each points in this space represents a pixel in the image. The centroid would look for high density data points, or in other words for pixels that share a similar color. So a chosen cluster would represent similarily colored pixels.

5. K-means clustering is way faster, making it more suitable for implemenations. It is also "pre-implemented", making it very easy to use.
